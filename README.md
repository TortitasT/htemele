# htemele

Compile HTML files with support for includes and SASS compilation.

Made for class since I can't use a framework nor JS and the teacher opens the HTML files directly on the browser.

## Usage
  
```bash
  cd path/to/project 
  htemele
```

Results in a `dist` folder with the compiled HTML and css files.

## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/TortitasT/htemele.git
  cd htemele
  deno install --allow-all main.ts
```
